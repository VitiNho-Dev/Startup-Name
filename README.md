# startup_namer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

You've written an interactive Flutter app that runs on both iOS and Android. In this codelab, you've:

- Written Dart code.
- Used hot reload for a faster development cycle.
- Implemented a stateful widget, adding interactivity to your app.
- Created a route and added logic for moving between the home route and the new route.
- Learned about changing the look of your app's UI using themes.
